# Test

You can test current browser by visiting and interact with next URLs:
* example.com
* wikipedia.org
* iana.org
* php.net
* cuni.cz
* ksvi.mff.cuni.cz
* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=example_of_wiki_search

You can also launch server at localhost, place there files from this folder
and test with them. Files contain PHP files, because launching C# server needs
special configuration
